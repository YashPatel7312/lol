      <h2>Be REAL</h2>
      <p>
        When you create an account on LOL, make sure to provide information that
        is complete, accurate, and current! We need you to be honest and
        authentic with us while using the app. Providing inaccurate information
        is a violation of our Terms of Service, so always be real and authentic
        while using LOL!
      </p>

      <h2>Be YOU</h2>
      <p>
        Be yourself when using LOL! Providing fake usernames or links can harm
        user trust. We’ll never ask for your passwords, so your account is safe
        with us. Check our Privacy Policy for more information.
      </p>

      <h2>Have fun!</h2>
      <p>
        LOL was created to help connect real-world friends digitally. Have fun,
