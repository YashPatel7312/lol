        LOL is meant to be a place that is fun and safe for all, where users can 
        be their authentic selves and deepen their connections with their real-world 
        friends in an online space. The LOL team has developed a complex safety 
        system and a dedicated Community Team that work day and night to keep you, 
        our users, safe. We’ve even added a variety of safety controls that allow 
        users to enhance the security of their inboxes in unique ways:
      </p>

      <h2>1. Blocked users</h2>
      <p>
        This safety setting displays a list of individuals blocked by the LOL user, 
        allowing the user to have an overview of everyone that they have blocked and 
        permitting them to unblock individuals at any time. This provides LOL users 
        an increased level of control over the security of their inbox.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Pause my link</h2>
      <p>
        This feature allows LOL users to pause their LOL link, meaning that they can 
        stop receiving messages in their LOL inbox for their chosen period of time. 
        If a user becomes overwhelmed by their volume of incoming messages, they can 
        pause their link for as long as they’d like, waiting to resume receiving 
        messages until they’re once again ready to use LOL. Currently, users can choose 
        to pause for preset times of 1, 6, or 24 hours, or they can choose to pause their 
        link indefinitely and can unpause whenever they’re comfortable.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Enhanced moderation</h2>
      <p>
        Users who turn on the enhanced moderation safety control will have even more messages 
        that meet LOL’s moderation criteria automatically filtered out, so these messages 
        never appear in users' inboxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taken together, these safety controls allow LOL users to manage the kind of content 
        they see in their inboxes, who can send them messages, and when they can receive 
        messages. In tandem, they provide another layer of security to protect our LOL community.
