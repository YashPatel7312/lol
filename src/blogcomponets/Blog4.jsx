          <p>
            After nearly two years of cooperating with the FTC’s investigation, we 
            view this resolution as an opportunity to make LOL better than ever for 
            our users and we think the agreement is in our best interest. While we 
            believe many of the allegations around the youth of our user base are f
            actually incorrect, we anticipate that the agreed upon age-gating and 
            other procedures will now provide direction for others in our space, and 
            hopefully improve policies generally.
